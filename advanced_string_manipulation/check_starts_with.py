# batch 7, Prog05. startswith() checks if the beginning part of the string matches 
# the function parameter. Create a program that does the same functionality 
# without using startswith() function.

# ask the user to enter a string
# ask the user to enter a prefix to check
# get the length of the prefix
# extract the beginning part of the string with the same length as the prefix
# compare the extracted part with the prefix
# print whether the string starts with the given prefix
# end
