# batch 7, Prog04. islower() checks if all characters of the string are in lowercase.
# Create a program that does the same functionality without using islower() function.

# ask the user to enter a string
# initialize a variable to track if all characters are lowercase
# loop through each character in the string
# check if the character is an uppercase letter
# if an uppercase letter is found, set the variable to False and break the loop
# print whether the string is entirely in lowercase
# end
