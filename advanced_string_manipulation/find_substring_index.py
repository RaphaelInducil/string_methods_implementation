# batch 7, Prog09. index() returns the first location of the function parameter 
# in the string. Create a program that does the same functionality 
# without using index() function.

# ask the user to enter a string
# ask the user to enter the substring to find
# get the length of the substring
# loop through the string while checking each position for a match
# if a match is found, print the index and exit the loop
# if no match is found, print a message indicating that the substring is not present
# end
