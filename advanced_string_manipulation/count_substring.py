# batch 7, Prog08. count() returns how many times the function parameter 
# appears in the string. Create a program that does the same functionality 
# without using count() function.

# ask the user to enter a string
# ask the user to enter the substring to count
# initialize a counter variable to zero
# get the length of the substring
# loop through the string while checking each position for a match
# if a match is found, increment the counter
# print the total count of occurrences
# end
