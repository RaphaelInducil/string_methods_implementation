# batch 7, Prog10. rindex() returns the first location of the function parameter 
# in the string starting from the last character. Create a program that does 
# the same functionality without using rindex() function.

# ask the user to enter a string
# ask the user to enter the substring to find
# get the length of the substring
# initialize a variable to store the index, set to -1 (not found)
# loop through the string in reverse order while checking each position for a match
# if a match is found, store the index and break the loop
# check if the substring was found and print the result
# end
